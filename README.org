* pingmoji
-- the most useless yet fun networking tool you've never heard of --
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you ever wanted to take a series of emojis, parse the first 4 bytes of their unicode data as ipv4 addresses, then chain together a series of logical bitwise operations and ping the result? Too bad! That's all this useless fucking crate can do.
** About
*** Why did you do this?
I don't know dude, I'm sorry.
*** How can I install it?
[[https://rustup.rs/][install rustup]] if you don't have it on your system already
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo install pingmoji
#+END_SRC

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pingmoji --help
Usage: pingmoji [OPTIONS] --emojis <EMOJIS>

Options:
  -e, --emojis <EMOJIS>
  -o, --operations <OPERATIONS>  [default: ]
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version

-e --emojis: string argument with a chain of emojis.

note: some emojis consist of less than 4 bytes of data, the program will panic
if you provide one in your chain. If you're using this anywhere near production,
that's on you dog.

technically you can dump other non-emoji unicode characters in here too, as long
as the character is more than 4 bytes it'll do its thing.

-o --operations: string argument representing the chain of bitwise operations to perform with the following constraints:
- must be equal to the number of emojis minus one
- only the following letters are permitted (case insensitive): [o,x,a], representing bitwise OR, XOR, and AND, respectively.

See the Examples section for how the operations argument works in action.

Pinging 0.0.0.0 with 4 bytes of data...
